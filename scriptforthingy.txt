Brian industries is a company that turns chocolate milk into penut butter.  Brian is 
the owner of that company.  Joe has infultrated Brian industries as the website developer 
under the orders of some unknown organization who refer to Joe as SgtJoeGetWrecked.
Joe will attempt to sabotage the company by ruining the company website and blame it on 
hackers as Brian easily reverts the damage via the magical time machine that Github 
provides.  In the end SgtJoeGetWrecked is left with bitter resentment for Github and 
he can't do anything about it.
